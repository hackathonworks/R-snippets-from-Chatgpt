compare_data_frames <- function(df1, df2, by) {
  # Find rows that are in df1 but not in df2
  dropped_rows <- anti_join(df1, df2, by = by)
  
  # Drop empty columns in dropped_rows
  dropped_rows <- dropped_rows[colSums(is.na(dropped_rows)) == 0]
  
  # Number of dropped rows
  dropped_rows_count <- nrow(dropped_rows)
  
  # Number of unique profiles dropped
  dropped_profiles_count <- n_distinct(dropped_rows[[by]])
  
  # Dropped profiles and their values
  dropped_profiles <- unique(dropped_rows[[by]])
  
  # Return results
  return(list(dropped_rows = dropped_rows, 
              dropped_rows_count = dropped_rows_count, 
              dropped_profiles_count = dropped_profiles_count,
              dropped_profiles = dropped_profiles))
}


result <- compare_data_frames(df1, df2, c("col1", "col3"))

# Display results
cat("Number of dropped rows:", result$dropped_rows_count, "\n")
cat("Number of dropped profiles:", result$dropped_profiles_count, "\n")
cat("Dropped profiles:")
print(result$dropped_profiles)
cat("Dropped rows:")
print(result$dropped_rows)


In this version of the code, the data frames df1 and df2 have two categorical columns: col1 and col3. The compare_data_frames function is called using both columns as the by argument, meaning the comparison will be made on both columns. The results are displayed as in the previous example.




output
Here is the expected output of the above code:

Number of dropped rows: 2 

Number of dropped profiles: 2 

Dropped profiles:
  col1 col3
4   D   Z
5   E   Y

Dropped rows:
  col1 col2 col3
4   D    4   Z
5   E    5   Y
The output shows that there are still 2 dropped rows and 2 dropped profiles, but now the comparison is made on both columns col1 and col3. The dropped profiles are the combinations of values "D" and "Z", and "E" and "Y" in the two columns, and the dropped rows are the 4th and 5th rows of df1.
